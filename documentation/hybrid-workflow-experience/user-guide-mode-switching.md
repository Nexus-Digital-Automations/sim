## Understanding the Three Modes

### üìä Visual Mode (Traditional)
- **What it is**: The familiar ReactFlow visual editor
- **Best for**: Creating workflows, detailed editing, understanding complex logic
- **Key features**: Drag-and-drop editing, visual connections, property panels

### üí¨ Conversational Mode (New)
- **What it is**: Natural language interaction with your workflow
- **Best for**: Running workflows, quick status checks, guided execution
- **Key features**: Chat interface, natural language commands, step-by-step guidance

### üîÑ Hybrid Mode (Recommended)
- **What it is**: Both interfaces working together in real-time
- **Best for**: Learning, debugging, collaborative work, comprehensive workflow management
- **Key features**: Synchronized views, mode switching, real-time updates

---

## Switching Between Modes

### Mode Selection Interface

The mode selector is located in the workflow toolbar and shows three options:

```
[ üëÅÔ∏è Visual ] [ üí¨ Chat ] [ üîÑ Hybrid ]
```

### Switch Methods

#### Method 1: Toolbar Toggle
1. Click the desired mode icon in the toolbar
2. Wait for the interface transition (1-2 seconds)
3. The selected mode becomes active immediately

#### Method 2: Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Alt + V**: Switch to Visual mode
- **Alt + C**: Switch to Conversational mode
- **Alt + H**: Switch to Hybrid mode
- **Tab**: Quick toggle between current mode and Hybrid

#### Method 3: Voice Commands (Hybrid/Chat mode)
- *"Switch to visual mode"*
- *"Show me the chat interface"*
- *"Enable hybrid view"*

#### Method 4: Context Menu

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Mode Switching Problems

**Issue**: "Mode switch button is grayed out"
**Solution**:
1. Ensure workflow is not currently executing
2. Check browser permissions for enhanced features
3. Refresh page if issue persists
4. Contact support if problem continues

**Issue**: "Chat mode shows 'Agent unavailable'"
**Solution**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify workspace permissions include AI features
3. Wait 30 seconds and try again (server may be restarting)
4. Switch to visual mode as fallback

**Issue**: "Visual and chat views show different states"
**Solution**:
1. Try switching modes to trigger sync
2. Refresh the page
3. Check for error messages in browser console
4. Report synchronization bugs to support

#### Performance Issues

**Issue**: "Hybrid mode is slow/laggy"
**Solution**:
