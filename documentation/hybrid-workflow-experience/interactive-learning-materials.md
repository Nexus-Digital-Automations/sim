## Quick Start Tutorial

### Tutorial 1: Your First Hybrid Workflow (15 minutes)

#### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment
```markdown
**Objective**: Enable hybrid mode and explore the interface

**Actions**:
1. Open any workflow in your Sim workspace
2. Look for the "Chat with Workflow" button in the toolbar
3. Click to activate conversational mode
4. Notice the split interface: visual editor on left, chat on right

**Expected Result**: You should see both interfaces active simultaneously

**Screenshot Reference**: [Interface with chat panel enabled]
```

#### Step 2: First Conversation
```markdown
**Objective**: Start your first conversation with a workflow

**Actions**:
1. In the chat panel, type: "Hello, what does this workflow do?"
2. Wait for the AI response explaining the workflow
3. Ask: "Show me the first step"
4. Notice how the visual editor highlights the corresponding node

**Expected Conversation**:
User: "Hello, what does this workflow do?"

AI: "Hello! This is a Customer Onboarding workflow with 6 steps. It handles new customer registration, sends welcome emails, creates accounts, and sets up initial preferences. Would you like me to walk you through each step or start running the workflow?"

User: "Show me the first step"

AI: "The first step is 'Validate Customer Data' (highlighted in green on the visual editor). This step checks that all required customer information is present and properly formatted. It validates email addresses, phone numbers, and required fields. Would you like to see the validation rules or move to the next step?"
```

#### Step 3: Mode Switching Practice
```markdown
**Objective**: Practice switching between different modes

**Actions**:
1. Click the "Visual" mode button - chat panel disappears
2. Click the "Chat" mode button - visual editor minimizes
3. Click the "Hybrid" mode button - both panels return
4. Try keyboard shortcuts: Alt+V, Alt+C, Alt+H

**Key Learning**: Each mode has distinct advantages for different tasks
```

### Tutorial 2: Executing Your First Workflow (20 minutes)

#### Step 1: Preparing Input Data
```markdown
**Objective**: Learn to provide input data through conversation

**Chat Example**:
User: "I want to run this workflow for a new customer"

AI: "Great! I'll need some customer information to get started. Can you provide:
- Customer name
- Email address
- Phone number
- Company name (optional)"

User: "Name is John Smith, email john.smith@example.com, phone 555-123-4567"

AI: "Perfect! I've recorded:
✓ Name: John Smith
✓ Email: john.smith@example.com
✓ Phone: 555-123-4567
✓ Company: (not provided - will use default)

Ready to start the workflow? I can run it step-by-step so you can see what happens, or run it automatically. What would you prefer?"
```

#### Step 2: Step-by-Step Execution
```markdown
**Objective**: Experience guided workflow execution

**Chat Flow**:
User: "Let's go step by step"

AI: "Excellent choice for learning! Starting step 1: Data Validation...

✅ Step 1 Complete: All customer data is valid
- Email format: ✓ Valid
- Phone format: ✓ Valid
- Required fields: ✓ Complete

Ready for Step 2: 'Send Welcome Email'? This will send a welcome message to john.smith@example.com using our standard template. Should I proceed?"

User: "Yes, send the email"

AI: "✅ Step 2 Complete: Welcome email sent successfully
- Sent to: john.smith@example.com
- Template: New Customer Welcome
- Delivery status: Confirmed

Moving to Step 3: 'Create User Account'..."
```

#### Step 3: Visual Synchronization
```markdown
**Objective**: Observe how chat actions update the visual editor

**What to Notice**:
- As each step executes, the corresponding visual node changes color
- Completed steps show green checkmarks
- Current step pulses or highlights
- Progress bar updates in real-time
- Connections between nodes show data flow

**Try This**: While the workflow runs, click on different nodes in the visual editor and notice how the chat provides context about each step.
```

C) Let you write a custom response"

User: "Create a standard response"

AI: "✅ Step 5: Generated standard response:

'Hi [Customer Name],

We understand you're having trouble with password reset. I've initiated a fresh password reset for your account. Please check your email (including spam folder) for reset instructions.

If you still have issues, please reply with your account email and we'll assist further.

Best regards,
Support Team'

Should I send this to the customer now?"
```

### Example 2: Data Processing Pipeline

#### Workflow Structure
```yaml
Name: "Daily Sales Report Generation"
Steps:
  1. Connect to Database
  2. Extract Sales Data
  3. Apply Filters and Calculations
  4. Generate Charts
  5. Format Report
  6. Email to Stakeholders
```

#### Advanced Conversation Features
```markdown
**Try These Advanced Commands**:

User: "Run the sales report but exclude refunded transactions"

AI: "I'll modify the filters for this run. In Step 3 'Apply Filters', I'll add:
- Exclude transactions with status = 'refunded'
- Keep all other standard filters (date range, completed sales)

Should I proceed with this modification?"

User: "Yes, and make the date range last 7 days instead of yesterday"

AI: "Perfect! Modified filters:
✓ Date range: Last 7 days (instead of yesterday)
✓ Exclude refunds: Yes
✓ Status: Completed sales only

This will give us a weekly view without any refunded transactions. Starting execution..."

**[Visual editor shows modified node with different color indicating customization]**
```

### Example 3: Multi-Branch Workflow

#### Conditional Logic Example
```markdown
**Workflow**: Invoice Processing with Approval Routing

User: "Process this invoice for $15,000"

AI: "I see this is a $15,000 invoice. Based on our approval rules:
- Amount > $10,000 requires manager approval
- Amount > $25,000 requires executive approval

This invoice will follow the Manager Approval path. I can see two routes ahead:

Route A: Manager Approves → Process Payment
Route B: Manager Rejects → Send Back to Requestor

Should I proceed and wait for manager approval, or would you like to simulate an approval decision for learning purposes?"

User: "Simulate manager approval"

AI: "Simulating manager approval... ✅ Approved!

Following the green path in your visual editor:
✅ Manager Review: Approved
→ Moving to 'Process Payment' step
→ Then 'Send Confirmation Email'
→ Finally 'Update Financial Records'

Notice how the visual editor shows the active path in green while the rejected path (in gray) shows what would have happened if the manager had rejected it."
```

## Scenario-Based Learning

### Scenario 1: Onboarding New Team Member

#### Context
```markdown
**Situation**: You're training a new team member on hybrid workflows
**Duration**: 30 minutes
**Learning Goals**:
- Understand when to use each mode
- Practice common troubleshooting
- Learn collaboration features
```

#### Guided Roleplay
```markdown
**You are the trainer. The new team member asks:**

"I'm confused about when to use visual mode vs. chat mode. Can you show me?"

**Your Response Options**:
A) "Let me show you with this marketing campaign workflow..."
B) "Great question! Let's start with your specific use case..."
C) "I'll demonstrate with three different scenarios..."

**Recommended Approach**: Choose option C and demonstrate:

1. **Visual Mode Example**:
   "When I'm building a new workflow, I use visual mode because I can see all the connections and logic clearly. Watch as I drag these nodes and connect them..."

2. **Chat Mode Example**:
   "When I just need to run a routine workflow, chat is faster. I can say 'run the monthly report' and monitor progress without the visual complexity..."

3. **Hybrid Mode Example**:
   "When I'm troubleshooting or learning, hybrid mode is perfect. I can see what's happening visually while asking questions. Let me show you..."
```

### Scenario 2: Troubleshooting a Stuck Workflow

#### Problem-Solving Exercise
```markdown
**Situation**: A workflow has been running for 20 minutes and seems stuck

**Chat Conversation**:
User: "My workflow seems stuck. It's been on step 3 for 20 minutes."

AI: "Let me help you troubleshoot. I can see the workflow is indeed waiting on Step 3: 'API Data Fetch'. Here are the likely causes:

🔍 Diagnostic Results:
- API endpoint responding: ✓ Yes (200 OK)
- Network connectivity: ✓ Good
- Rate limiting: ⚠️ Possible (487 requests in last hour)
- Timeout settings: ⚠️ Current timeout: 30 minutes

**Most likely cause**: Rate limiting from the external API

**Suggested Actions**:
A) Wait for rate limit reset (in ~10 minutes)
B) Retry with backoff strategy
C) Skip this step and process manually
D) Cancel and reschedule for later

What would you like to do?"

**Learning Exercise**: Try each option and see the different outcomes and visual feedback.
```

### Scenario 3: Optimizing Workflow Performance

#### Performance Analysis Workshop
```markdown
**Scenario Setup**:

- Business wants it under 15 minutes
- Multiple optimization opportunities exist

**Investigation Process**:

User: "This workflow is too slow. Can you help me identify bottlenecks?"

AI: "I'll analyze the performance data from recent runs:

📊 **Performance Breakdown** (Average times):
- Step 1 (Data Collection): 2 minutes ✅ Good
- Step 2 (Data Processing): 28 minutes ⚠️ BOTTLENECK
- Step 3 (Report Generation): 12 minutes ⚠️ Slow
- Step 4 (Email Delivery): 3 minutes ✅ Good

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Step 2 processes 50,000 records sequentially
- Step 3 generates 47 different charts
- Both could benefit from parallel processing

**Optimization Suggestions**:
1. Enable parallel processing in Step 2 (estimated 80% reduction)
2. Generate only essential charts in Step 3 (estimated 60% reduction)

## Troubleshooting Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "The Mysterious Timeout"

#### Problem Description
```markdown
**User Report**: "My workflow keeps timing out, but it worked fine last week"

**Initial Investigation**:
Chat with user reveals:
- Same workflow, no changes made
- Different results each time it runs
- Sometimes completes in 5 minutes, sometimes times out at 30 minutes
- Timeout happens at different steps

**Your Diagnostic Process**:
Use hybrid mode to investigate systematically
```

#### Diagnostic Conversation
```markdown
User: "Help me figure out why this workflow is inconsistent"

AI: "Inconsistent performance suggests external dependencies or resource contention. Let me check:

🔍 **System Health Check**:
- Server resources: ✅ Normal (CPU: 45%, Memory: 62%)
- Database connections: ⚠️ High (85 of 100 connections used)
- External API status: ⚠️ Variable response times (2-45 seconds)
- Network latency: ⚠️ Inconsistent (50-800ms)

**Root Cause Identified**: External API performance is highly variable
- Monday mornings: High load (slow responses)
- Weekends: Low load (fast responses)
- Current time: Peak usage period

**Solutions**:
1. Add retry logic with exponential backoff
2. Implement API response caching
3. Use alternative API during peak times
4. Increase timeout thresholds during known peak periods

Would you like me to implement solution #1 first?"
```

### Scenario 2: "The Sync Problem"

#### Issue Description
```markdown
**Problem**: Visual editor and chat interface showing different states

**User Experience**:
- Chat says "Step 3 completed successfully"
- Visual editor shows Step 3 still in progress
- Confusion about actual workflow state
- Unable to proceed confidently
```

#### Resolution Steps
```markdown
**Troubleshooting Process**:

Step 1: Identify sync issue
User: "My visual and chat interfaces don't match"

AI: "I detect a synchronization issue. Let me force a refresh of both interfaces...

🔄 **Sync Status Check**:
- Visual editor state: Step 3 (In Progress)
- Chat interface state: Step 3 (Completed)
- Database state: Step 3 (Completed at 14:32:18)
- Socket connection: ⚠️ Degraded

**Issue Found**: Network interruption caused missed state update

**Resolution**:
1. Reconnecting real-time updates... ✅
2. Synchronizing visual editor... ✅
3. Validating state consistency... ✅

Both interfaces now show: Step 3 ✅ Completed, Step 4 ⏳ In Progress"

Step 2: Prevention
AI: "To prevent this in the future, I've enabled:
- Enhanced connection monitoring
- Automatic state reconciliation
- Offline state caching
- Connection recovery notifications"
```

### Scenario 3: "The Performance Mystery"

#### Complex Performance Issue
```markdown
**Situation**: Workflow performance degrades over time

- Run 3: 2.8 GB → 3.6 GB (memory leak detected)
- Run 4: 3.6 GB → 4.9 GB (critical)

**Database Connection Pool**:
- Run 1: 5 connections used
- Run 2: 8 connections used
- Run 3: 12 connections used
- Run 4: 18 connections used (connections not releasing)

**Root Cause**: Memory and connection leaks in Step 2 'Data Processing'

**Technical Details**:
- Large objects not being garbage collected
- Database connections not properly closed
- Cache growing without bounds

**Solutions Applied**:
1. ✅ Fixed connection cleanup in Step 2
2. ✅ Added explicit garbage collection triggers
3. ✅ Implemented cache size limits
4. ✅ Added resource monitoring alerts

**Verification**: Next run should show consistent 8-minute performance"
