## Tips & Best Practices

### Getting Better Results

#### Be Clear and Specific
**Good examples:**

✅ "I'm getting a 404 error when trying to access /admin on my WordPress site"
✅ "Can you show me how to add a new user to my team workspace?"
✅ "My email campaigns have a 2% open rate. How can I improve this?"
```

**Avoid vague requests:**
```
❌ "My site is broken"
❌ "Email isn't working"
❌ "Make it better"
```

#### Provide Relevant Context
Include information that helps the agent understand your situation:
- **Your role**: Admin, user, developer, etc.
- **Environment**: Production, staging, development
- **Urgency level**: Critical, normal, low priority
- **Previous attempts**: What you've already tried

#### Use Natural Language
You don't need to use formal or technical language:
```
✅ "Hey, can you help me figure out why my site loads slowly?"
✅ "I'm confused about how to set up SSL certificates"
✅ "What's the easiest way to backup my database?"
```

### Common Communication Patterns

#### Asking for Help
```
1. State the problem clearly
2. Describe what you expected to happen
3. Explain what actually happened
4. Mention any error messages
5. List what you've already tried
```

**Example:**
```
You: I'm trying to install a WordPress plugin, but I keep getting an error. I expected it to install normally, but instead I get "Installation failed: Could not create directory." I've tried uploading via FTP and through the admin panel. Both methods fail with the same error.
```

#### Requesting Information
```
You: Can you show me my current subscription details?

🤖 Here are your current subscription details:
[Shows structured information]

You: Thanks! Can you also show me my usage statistics?
```

#### Following Instructions
```
🤖 To fix this issue, please follow these steps:
1. Go to your dashboard
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Find "Security" section
4. Toggle "Enable 2FA"

You: I'm on step 3 but I don't see a "Security" section. Can you help?

🤖 No problem! The Security section might be labeled differently. Look for "Account Protection" or "Privacy & Security" instead.
```

### Troubleshooting Communication Issues

#### If the Agent Doesn't Understand
```
🤖 I'm not sure I understand. Could you please rephrase your question?

You: Let me try explaining differently. I want to change the colors on my website's header.

🤖 Ah, I understand now! You want to customize your website's header colors. I can help with that.
```

#### If You Get Stuck in a Loop
```
You: We keep going in circles. Can we start over with this issue?

🤖 Of course! Let's start fresh. Please describe the main issue you're trying to solve.
```

#### If You Need Different Help
```
You: This isn't quite what I need. Can I talk to someone who specializes in email marketing?

🤖 I understand. Let me connect you with our email marketing specialist.
```

### Privacy and Security Tips

#### What to Share
**Safe to share:**
- General description of problems
- Non-sensitive configuration questions
- Public website URLs
- General account questions

#### What Not to Share
**Never share:**
- Passwords or API keys
- Credit card numbers
- Social Security numbers
- Private personal information
- Sensitive business data

#### If You Accidentally Share Sensitive Info
```
You: Oh no, I just typed my password by mistake!

🤖 No worries! For security, I cannot see or store passwords. However, I recommend changing your password as a precaution. Would you like help with that?
```

### Making the Most of Your Chat Experience

```

#### End Conversations Appropriately
```
