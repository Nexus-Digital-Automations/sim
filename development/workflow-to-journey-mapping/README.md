# Workflow to Journey Mapping System Documentation

## Overview

The Workflow to Journey Mapping System is a comprehensive solution that bridges Sim's ReactFlow visual workflows with Parlant's conversational AI framework. This system enables users to interact with complex multi-step workflows through natural language conversations while preserving all the power and functionality of the original visual workflow editor.
