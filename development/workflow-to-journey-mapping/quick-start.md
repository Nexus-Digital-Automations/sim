## Step 1: Open Any Workflow (30 seconds)

## Step 2: Start Your First Conversation (1 minute)

Click the **"üí¨ Chat"** button. A chat panel will appear with a welcome message:

```
üëã Hello! I'm your workflow assistant.

This workflow "Customer Onboarding" has 5 steps:
‚Ä¢ Validate customer data
‚Ä¢ Create user account
‚Ä¢ Send welcome email
‚Ä¢ Set up integrations
‚Ä¢ Schedule follow-up

I can help you run this workflow step-by-step or answer questions about it.
What would you like to do?
```

**Try your first command** by typing any of these:

- *"Start the workflow"*
- *"What does this workflow do?"*
- *"Show me the steps"*

## Step 3: Run Your Workflow (2 minutes)

Let's run through a complete workflow execution:

### Start Execution
Type: *"Let's begin"* or *"Start the workflow"*

```
Assistant: Great! Starting the Customer Onboarding workflow.

üîÑ Step 1: Validate customer data
I'm checking the customer information you provided...

‚úÖ Validation complete! All customer data looks good.
Ready for step 2. Should I continue?
```

### Continue or Control
You can respond with:
- *"Yes, continue"* - Proceeds automatically
- *"Explain step 2"* - Get details about the next step
- *"Pause here"* - Stop for review

### Watch Progress
The assistant keeps you updated:

```
Assistant: ‚úÖ Step 2: User account created successfully
‚úÖ Step 3: Welcome email sent to john@example.com
üîÑ Step 4: Setting up integrations...
```

## Step 4: Explore Commands (1 minute)

Try these natural language commands:

| Say This | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| *"What's the status?"* | Shows current progress |
| *"Pause"* | Stops execution |
| *"Skip this step"* | Moves to next step |
| *"Go back"* | Returns to previous step |
| *"What went wrong?"* | Explains any errors |
| *"Show me options"* | Lists available actions |

## Step 5: Try Different Modes (30 seconds)

Switch between interface modes using the toolbar buttons:

- **üëÅ Visual**: Traditional workflow editor
- **üí¨ Chat**: Pure conversational interface
- **‚ö° Both**: Side-by-side view

In "Both" mode, you can see your workflow progress visually while chatting!

‚úÖ **Enable chat mode** on any workflow
‚úÖ **Start workflows** with natural language
