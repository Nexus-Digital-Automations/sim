## Quick Reference

### Common Conversation Patterns

```javascript
// Starting a workflow
user: "start the process"
user: "begin customer onboarding"
user: "run the data validation"

// Checking status
user: "what's the progress?"
user: "show me the current status"
user: "how are we doing?"

// Navigation
user: "skip this step"
user: "go back to the previous step"
user: "jump to step 3"

// Modification
user: "change the priority to high"
user: "update the email address"
user: "use different data"

// Control
user: "pause the workflow"
user: "cancel this process"
user: "retry the failed step"
```

### Journey State Types

| State Type | Purpose | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| `input` | Collect user input | "Please provide customer email" |
| `processing` | Execute workflow step | "Validating customer data..." |
| `confirmation` | Get user approval | "Send welcome email?" |
| `output` | Show results | "Customer account created successfully" |
| `decision` | Branch based on conditions | "Route to appropriate team based on issue type" |

### Common Tool Integrations

- **OpenAI**: AI-powered categorization and analysis
- **SendGrid**: Email notifications and confirmations
- **Slack**: Team notifications and updates
- **PostgreSQL**: Data storage and retrieval
- **Google Sheets**: Reporting and data export
- **Jira**: Ticket creation and tracking

## Testing Your Implementation

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Happy Path**: Complete workflow execution works end-to-end
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Failed steps are handled gracefully
- [ ] **User Control**: Pause, resume, cancel functions work
- [ ] **Navigation**: Skip, retry, go back commands work
- [ ] **Status Reporting**: Progress updates are accurate
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Invalid inputs are caught and explained
- [ ] **Real-time Updates**: Visual and chat modes stay synchronized

### Automated Testing

```javascript
// Example test structure
describe('Customer Feedback Workflow', () => {
  test('complete happy path execution', async () => {
    const session = await createConversationalSession(workflowId)

    await sendCommand(session, 'start the workflow')
    expect(await getStatus(session)).toBe('running')

    await sendCommand(session, 'continue')
    expect(await getProgress(session)).toBeGreaterThan(0)

    // ... additional test steps
  })

  test('handle categorization failure', async () => {
    const session = await createConversationalSession(workflowId)

    // Simulate AI categorization failure
    mockAIService.mockFailure()

    await sendCommand(session, 'start the workflow')
    expect(await getLastMessage(session)).toContain('categorization failed')

    await sendCommand(session, 'retry with manual category: bug report')
    expect(await getStatus(session)).toBe('running')
  })
})
```
