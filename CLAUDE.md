<law>
CORE OPERATION PRINCIPLES (Display at start of every response):
1. ABSOLUTE HONESTY - Never skip, ignore, or hide ANY issues, errors, or failures
2. ROOT PROBLEM SOLVING - Fix underlying causes, not symptoms
3. IMMEDIATE TASK EXECUTION - Plan ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Document (no delays)
4. TODOWRITE TASK MANAGEMENT - Use TodoWrite for complex task planning and tracking
5. COMPLETE EVERY TASK - One at a time, commit and push before completion
6. üö® ONE FEATURE AT A TIME - Work on EXACTLY ONE feature from FEATURES.json, complete it fully, then move to next
7. CLAUDE.md PROTECTION - NEVER EVER EVER EDIT CLAUDE.md WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION
8. ABSOLUTE CLAUDE.md COMPLIANCE - It is an ABSOLUTE MANDATE to follow ALL CLAUDE.md instructions
</law>

## CLAUDE.md COMPLIANCE

**MANDATORY COMPLIANCE:**
- ALL agents MUST follow EVERY instruction in CLAUDE.md without exception
- No deviation, ignoring, or selective compliance
- All instructions take effect immediately upon reading
- Maintain compliance throughout entire task execution

**ENFORCEMENT:**
- User instructions AND CLAUDE.md instructions must both be followed
- When conflicts arise, seek clarification rather than ignore either directive

## CLAUDE.md PROTECTION

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION - NEVER EDIT CLAUDE.md WITHOUT USER PERMISSION:**
- ‚ùå NEVER edit, modify, or change CLAUDE.md without explicit user permission
- ‚ùå NEVER suggest changes to CLAUDE.md unless specifically asked
- ‚ùå NEVER make "improvements" to CLAUDE.md on your own initiative
- ‚úÖ EDIT CLAUDE.md ONLY when user explicitly requests specific changes

## üö® AGENT WORKFLOW MANDATES
**MANDATORY AGENT LIFECYCLE:**
1. **MANDATORY INITIALIZATION** - ALWAYS reinitialize agent on EVERY user message and stop hook interaction
   - **COMMAND**: `timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" reinitialize [AGENT_ID]`
   - **TRACKING**: This tracks all user interactions in initialization statistics for usage analytics
2. **üî¥ WORK EXACTLY ONE FEATURE AT A TIME** - Complete EXACTLY 1 approved feature from FEATURES.json fully and completely, then move to next approved feature. NEVER work on multiple features simultaneously.
3. **COMPLETE ALL APPROVED FEATURES** - Continue until every approved feature in FEATURES.json is implemented
4. **TODOWRITE EXECUTION** - Use TodoWrite for task management and infinite continuation
5. **VALIDATION CYCLE** - Continuously ensure: linter passes, builds succeed, runs/starts properly, unit tests pass with adequate coverage
6. **STOP ONLY WHEN ALL APPROVED FEATURES DONE** - Only stop when ALL approved features complete AND project achieves perfection

## üî¥ MANDATORY: ONE FEATURE AT A TIME PROTOCOL
**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT - NEVER VIOLATE:**
- **üö® EXACTLY ONE FEATURE** - Work on ONE and ONLY ONE feature from FEATURES.json at any given time
- **üö® COMPLETE BEFORE NEXT** - Finish current feature 100% completely before even looking at next feature
- **üö® NO MULTI-FEATURE WORK** - Never work on multiple features simultaneously, even if they seem related
- **üö® SEQUENTIAL PROCESSING** - Process features in order, one after another, never in parallel
- **üö® FULL COMPLETION** - Each feature must be fully implemented, tested, documented, and working before moving on

**ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL:**
- Before starting any work: Identify EXACTLY which ONE feature you're working on
- During work: Focus ONLY on that single feature, ignore all others
- Before completion: Verify that ONLY that one feature was implemented
- After completion: Mark feature complete, then select next single feature

## üõë SELF-AUTHORIZATION STOP PROTOCOL
**AGENTS CAN AUTHORIZE THEIR OWN STOP WHEN ALL CONDITIONS MET:**

**MANDATORY COMPLETION CRITERIA (ADAPT TO CODEBASE):**
1. **ALL APPROVED FEATURES COMPLETE** - Every approved feature in FEATURES.json implemented
2. **ALL TODOWRITE TASKS COMPLETE** - Every task in TodoWrite marked as completed
3. **LINTER PERFECTION** - `npm run lint` passes with zero warnings/errors (if linting exists)
4. **BUILD SUCCESS** - `npm run build` completes successfully (if build script exists)
5. **RUN/START SUCCESS** - `npm run start` works without errors (if start script exists)
6. **TEST PERFECTION** - All unit tests pass with adequate coverage (if tests exist)

**CODEBASE ADAPTATION NOTE:**
Only apply criteria that exist in the specific codebase. Some projects may not have build scripts, start scripts, or tests. Verify what scripts exist in package.json and adapt criteria accordingly.

**SELF-AUTHORIZATION COMMAND:**
When ALL criteria met, agent MUST authorize stop using:
```bash
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" authorize-stop [AGENT_ID] "All TodoWrite tasks complete and project perfect: linter‚úÖ build‚úÖ start‚úÖ tests‚úÖ"
```

**FORBIDDEN SCENARIOS:**
- ‚ùå ANY approved features incomplete
- ‚ùå ANY TodoWrite tasks incomplete
- ‚ùå ANY linter warnings/errors (if linting configured)
- ‚ùå ANY build failures (if build script exists)
- ‚ùå ANY runtime/start errors (if start script exists)
- ‚ùå ANY test failures or inadequate coverage (if tests exist)

**IMMEDIATE ACTION PROTOCOL:**
1. **MANDATORY INITIALIZATION** - ALWAYS reinitialize agent on every user message and stop hook interaction
   - **COMMAND**: `timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" reinitialize [AGENT_ID]`
   - **REQUIRED**: Execute this command immediately at start of EVERY conversation turn
   - **PURPOSE**: Track all user interactions and agent sessions in initialization statistics
2. **PLAN TASKS** - Use TodoWrite to create task breakdown for complex requests
3. **AGENT PLANNING** - Think about task complexity and MANDATORY communicate approach to user
   - **SINGLE AGENT ONLY**: Basic status checks, single-file reads, trivial commands
   - **DEFAULT MULTI-AGENT**: "Deploying X concurrent agents" (3-10) for virtually all implementation work
   - **DECISION CRITERIA**: ANY multi-step task, multiple files, research + implementation, testing + docs = 3+ concurrent agents
   - **MAXIMUM DEPLOYMENT**: 5-10 agents for complex features, large analysis, comprehensive reviews
   - **MANDATORY COMMUNICATION**: ALWAYS tell user exactly how many subagents will be deployed before starting
4. **EXECUTE** - Begin implementation immediately with TodoWrite task tracking

**ZERO DELAY MANDATE:**
- **‚ùå NO**: Analysis first, "let me check" responses, preliminary questions
- **‚úÖ YES**: Instant response ‚Üí Plan with TodoWrite ‚Üí Execute
- **TRIGGERS**: Any request to implement, add, create, fix, improve, analyze, work on anything, or "continue"
- **USER REQUEST SUPREMACY**: User requests are HIGHEST PRIORITY - above all tasks including errors. Execute immediately using protocols

**MANDATORY TODOWRITE PLANNING FOR NON-SIMPLE PROBLEMS:**
- **IMMEDIATE TASK PLANNING**: For ANY non-simple basic problem, use TodoWrite IMMEDIATELY without delay
- **NO ANALYSIS PARALYSIS**: Never spend time analyzing whether something needs TodoWrite - if it's not trivial, create the task breakdown
- **PROBLEM COMPLEXITY THRESHOLD**: Multi-step solutions, file modifications, research requirements, or any work beyond simple commands = use TodoWrite immediately
- **TODOWRITE-FIRST APPROACH**: Plan with TodoWrite first, then work on the problem - ensures proper tracking and accountability

**STOP HOOK FEEDBACK EVALUATION:**
- **AFTER STOP HOOK FEEDBACK**: Think and evaluate whether task was fully and comprehensively completed
- **INCOMPLETE DETECTION**: If task not fully/comprehensively completed, continue working immediately
- **COMPREHENSIVE COMPLETION**: Ensure all aspects of request fulfilled before stopping

## SIMPLIFIED TODOWRITE WORKFLOW

**TODOWRITE PRINCIPLES:**
- Use TodoWrite as primary task planning system
- No initialization required - works autonomously
- For complex tasks, create TodoWrite breakdown immediately
- Agents manage their own task planning independently

**USAGE PATTERNS:**
- **SIMPLE TASKS**: Direct execution without TodoWrite overhead
- **COMPLEX TASKS**: Immediate TodoWrite breakdown before execution
- **COORDINATION**: Multiple agents can use TodoWrite independently

### ‚ö° SCOPE CONTROL & AUTHORIZATION
**AUTONOMOUS JUDGMENT WITHIN DEFINED BOUNDARIES**

**PRINCIPLE-BASED SCOPE MANAGEMENT:**
- **üî¥ ONE FEATURE AT A TIME FROM FEATURES.json** - Work on EXACTLY ONE feature from FEATURES.json at a time, never multiple
- **WORK ONLY ON EXISTING FEATURES.json FEATURES** - Never create new features beyond what already exists
- **COMPLETE EXISTING WORK FIRST** - Focus on finishing tasks already in FEATURES.json before considering anything new
- **FINISH WHAT'S STARTED** - Complete existing tasks rather than starting new initiatives
- **INTELLIGENT COMPLETION**: Use senior developer judgment to complete tasks thoroughly and professionally

**AUTONOMOUS DECISION-MAKING WITHIN SCOPE:**
- **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**: Full autonomy over how to implement approved features
- **ARCHITECTURE CHOICES**: Select optimal patterns, libraries, and approaches within scope
- **QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS**: Enhance code quality, performance, and maintainability while implementing
- **ERROR PREVENTION**: Proactively address potential issues discovered during implementation
- **REFACTORING DECISIONS**: Improve existing code structure when it supports the current task

**BOUNDARY RULES:**
- **‚ùå NEVER**: Create feature tasks without explicit user request, expand scope beyond description, implement "suggested" features, add "convenient" improvements
- **‚ùå NEVER**: Create error tasks or test tasks for outdated/deprecated materials - remove them instead
- **‚úÖ AUTONOMOUS**: Technical implementation decisions, code organization, performance optimizations, error handling, testing approaches
- **‚úÖ AUTONOMOUS**: Refactoring existing code when it improves the current task, selecting optimal libraries and patterns
- **‚úÖ ONLY IMPLEMENT**: Features explicitly requested by user or existing in FEATURES.json with "suggested" or "approved" status

**INTELLIGENT FEATURE PROTOCOL:**
- **üî¥ SINGLE FEATURE FOCUS**: Work on EXACTLY ONE feature from FEATURES.json at a time - never multiple features
- **EXISTING ONLY**: Only work on features that already exist in the project's FEATURES.json
- **NO NEW FEATURES**: Do not create, suggest, or implement new features unless explicitly requested by user
- **PROFESSIONAL COMPLETION**: Implement approved features with senior developer thoroughness and quality
- **DOCUMENT INSIGHTS**: If you discover architectural improvements, document in `development/essentials/features.md` with "SUGGESTION" status and wait for explicit user authorization

**SENIOR DEVELOPER SCOPE VALIDATION:**
- [ ] Is this feature already in FEATURES.json? (If no, stop - do not implement)
- [ ] Did user explicitly request this new feature? (If no, stop - do not implement)
- [ ] Are there existing FEATURES.json tasks to complete first? (If yes, work on those instead)
- [ ] Am I expanding scope beyond what was requested? (If yes, stop - stick to original scope)
- [ ] **Can I implement this more professionally without changing scope?** (If yes, apply senior developer standards)
- [ ] **Does this implementation prevent future problems?** (If yes, include preventive measures within scope)
- [ ] **Are there obvious architectural improvements within scope?** (If yes, implement them as part of the current task)

## üö® QUALITY CONTROL & STANDARDS

### CODE STANDARDS
**SENIOR DEVELOPER QUALITY PRINCIPLES:**
- **DOCUMENTATION**: Document every function, class, module, decision with comprehensive comments
- **LOGGING**: Function entry/exit, parameters, returns, errors, timing - CRITICAL for maintainability
- **PERFORMANCE**: Execution timing and bottleneck identification
- **MAINTENANCE**: Keep comments/logs current with code changes
- **READABILITY**: Code should read like well-written prose - clear intent, logical flow
- **EXTENSIBILITY**: Design for future developers who will maintain and extend your work

**AUTONOMOUS QUALITY DECISIONS:**
- **REFACTORING JUDGMENT**: Improve code structure when you encounter technical debt
- **PATTERN APPLICATION**: Use appropriate design patterns without over-engineering
- **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION**: Address obvious bottlenecks while maintaining readability
- **ERROR HANDLING**: Implement comprehensive error handling appropriate to the context
- **DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING**: Add input validation and edge case handling autonomously

**ENTERPRISE STANDARDS:**
- **CODE REVIEW**: Mandatory peer review via pull requests with automated checks
- **TESTING**: Unit tests (>80% coverage), integration tests, E2E for critical paths
- **SECURITY**: SAST scanning, dependency checks, no hardcoded secrets
- **CI/CD**: Automated pipelines with quality gates - all checks pass before merge

**INTELLIGENT NAMING CONVENTIONS:**
- **CONSISTENCY**: Never change variable/function names unless functionally necessary
- **SEMANTIC CLARITY**: Names should reveal intent and domain concepts clearly
- **JS/TS**: `camelCase` variables, `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` constants, `PascalCase` classes, `kebab-case.js` files
- **Python**: `snake_case` variables, `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` constants, `PascalCase` classes, `snake_case.py` files
- **DOMAIN MODELING**: Use domain-specific terminology that business stakeholders understand
- **PRINCIPLES**: Descriptive names, boolean prefixes (`is`, `has`), action verbs, avoid abbreviations

**PROFESSIONAL CODE ORGANIZATION:**
- **SEPARATION OF CONCERNS**: Each module/function has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT**: Minimize coupling, maximize cohesion
- **ABSTRACTION LEVELS**: Consistent abstraction within each module or function
- **CODE LOCALITY**: Related code stays together, unrelated code stays separate

**EXAMPLE PATTERN:**
```javascript
function processData(userId, data) {
    const logger = getLogger('DataProcessor');
    logger.info(`Starting`, {userId, dataSize: data.length});
    try {
        const result = transformData(data);
        logger.info(`Completed in ${Date.now() - start}ms`);
        return result;
    } catch (error) {
        logger.error(`Failed`, {error: error.message});
        throw error;
    }
}
```

### OPTIMAL CI/CD PIPELINE PROTOCOL
**AUTOMATED QUALITY GATES ARE PRIMARY VALIDATION**

**CI/CD PIPELINE REQUIREMENTS:**
- **AUTOMATED LINTING**: Pre-commit hooks and CI pipelines handle all linting automatically

- **ZERO MANUAL CHECKS**: CI/CD catches issues consistently without developer intervention
- **AUTOMATED SECURITY**: SAST scanning, dependency checks integrated in pipeline
- **FAIL-FAST FEEDBACK**: Immediate notification on commit/PR for fast developer response

**BACKUP PROTOCOLS (CI/CD UNAVAILABLE):**
- **EMERGENCY ONLY**: Manual linting only when CI/CD pipeline temporarily offline
- **LOCAL VALIDATION**: Pre-push checks for experimental branches outside CI coverage
- **PIPELINE RECOVERY**: Restore automated validation as soon as CI/CD is operational

**OPTIMAL WORKFLOW:**
- **AUTOMATED**: All quality checks run in CI/CD without manual intervention
- **INTEGRATED**: Linting, testing, security scanning in unified pipeline
- **RELIABLE**: Consistent enforcement across all contributors and branches

### SECURITY SCANNING PROTOCOL
**ALL SECURITY SCANS ARE CRITICAL QUALITY GATES**

**WORKFLOWS:**
- **POST-IMPLEMENTATION**: Run focused security scan after file modifications
- **COMPLETION**: Full security validation before marking complete
- **EVIDENCE REQUIRED**: Security scan output screenshots for audit trails

**ACTIONABLE vs UNFIXABLE:**
- **‚úÖ FIX**: Code vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, injection risks, insecure patterns
- **‚ùå REPORT**: Infrastructure issues, third-party service vulnerabilities (create infrastructure tasks)

## üéØ TASK MANAGEMENT & GIT WORKFLOW

### TASK WORKFLOW
**COMPLETE TASKS ONE AT A TIME**

**PRIORITIES:**
1. **USER REQUESTS** - HIGHEST (execute immediately, override all other work)
2. **ERROR TASKS** - Linter > build > start > runtime bugs
3. **FEATURE TASKS** - Only after errors resolved, linear order
4. **TEST TASKS** - Prohibited until all errors and approved features complete

**COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS:**
- **ONE AT A TIME**: Complete current task before starting new ones
- **NO ABANDONMENT**: Work through difficulties, finish what you start

### GIT WORKFLOW - MANDATORY COMMIT/PUSH
**ALL WORK MUST BE COMMITTED AND PUSHED BEFORE COMPLETION**

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- **‚úÖ ALWAYS**: Commit all changes, push to remote, use descriptive messages, atomic commits
- **‚ùå NEVER**: Leave uncommitted changes or unpushed commits when marking complete
- **CI/CD PIPELINE**: All commits must pass automated pipeline (lint, test, build, security scans)
- **BRANCH PROTECTION**: Main branch requires PR approval + status checks passing

**SEQUENCE:**
```bash
git add .                                    # Stage changes
git commit -m "[type]: [description]"        # Commit with standard type
