# ðŸ§ª Comprehensive Chat Testing Framework

## Overview

This comprehensive testing framework validates all aspects of the Parlant React Chat Interface functionality, including UI components, real-time communication, agent interactions, security, and performance.

## Architecture

The framework is designed with specialized testing modules:

### 1. UI Component Testing
- **Location**: `ui-components/`
- **Purpose**: Component rendering, visual regression, accessibility
- **Coverage**: Chat components, message bubbles, agent selectors, input fields

### 2. Real-time Communication Testing
- **Location**: `realtime-communication/`
- **Purpose**: WebSocket connections, message delivery, network resilience
- **Coverage**: Socket.io integration, message queuing, reconnection handling

### 3. Agent Integration Testing
- **Location**: `agent-integration/`
- **Purpose**: Agent lifecycle, handoffs, response quality
- **Coverage**: Agent creation, conversation flows, performance metrics

### 4. Security and Isolation Testing
- **Location**: `security-isolation/`
- **Purpose**: Workspace isolation, authentication, data protection
- **Coverage**: Multi-tenant security, permission validation, data leakage prevention

### 5. Performance Testing
- **Location**: `performance/`
- **Purpose**: Load testing, latency measurement, scalability
- **Coverage**: Concurrent users, message throughput, memory usage

### 6. End-to-End Testing
- **Location**: `e2e/`
- **Purpose**: Complete user journeys, integration validation
- **Coverage**: Full conversation flows, cross-component integration

## Test Execution
