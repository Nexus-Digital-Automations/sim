## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Node.js 18+ (for tooling)
- Docker (recommended)

### Basic Setup
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/sim/parlant-integration-bridge.git
cd parlant-integration-bridge

# Environment setup
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configuration
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Database setup
python migrations/migrate.py

# Start development server
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload
```

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/health
```

### Basic API Usage
```bash
# Get authentication status
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_sim_token>" \
     http://localhost:8001/api/v1/auth/status

# Create an agent
curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_sim_token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"Test Agent","workspace_id":"your_workspace_id"}' \
     http://localhost:8001/api/v1/agents
```

- **Token Validation**: Real-time session validation with intelligent caching

### ‚ö° **Performance & Scalability**
- **Async Architecture**: FastAPI-based async implementation for high performance
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized database connection management
- **Intelligent Caching**: Multi-layer caching for authentication and frequent operations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless design enables easy scaling across instances

### üìä **Monitoring & Observability**
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Comprehensive metrics for monitoring and alerting
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with contextual information
- **Health Checks**: Multi-layer health monitoring with automated recovery
- **Performance Tracking**: Response time and error rate monitoring

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- All data encrypted in transit (TLS/HTTPS)
- Database connections use SSL/TLS encryption
- Sensitive configuration via environment variables or secrets manager
- No hardcoded credentials or API keys in source code

### Access Control
- JWT-based authentication with configurable expiration
- Workspace-scoped authorization on all operations
- Role-based permissions inherited from Sim system
- API rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Audit & Compliance
- Comprehensive audit logging of all operations
- Request tracing with unique correlation IDs
- Data retention policies configurable per workspace
- GDPR compliance considerations for user data

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Requirements
- **Development**: 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 20GB storage
- **Production**: 4+ vCPU, 8+ GB RAM, 100+ GB storage with backups
- **Database**: Shared PostgreSQL instance with Sim (recommended) or dedicated instance

### Scaling Strategies
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Deploy multiple instances behind load balancer
- **Database Scaling**: Connection pooling, read replicas for heavy read workloads
- **Caching**: Redis for distributed caching across instances
- **CDN**: Static assets and frequently accessed data

### Monitoring Requirements
- **Metrics**: Prometheus for metrics collection and alerting
- **Logging**: Centralized logging with ELK stack or similar
- **APM**: Application performance monitoring for request tracing
- **Alerting**: PagerDuty, Slack, or email integration for critical issues
